## Hypixel Skyblock Remake in Python.

**This project is a command-line-based fantasy RPG game.** You type commands to play the game. **Many mechanics and content are a bit different from the original Hypixel Skyblock**, but I'm trying to make it as close to the original Hypixel Skyblock as possible.

I started this project because **my friends couldn't log onto Hypixel**. I'm also learning many of the mechanics and getting better at Hypixel Skyblock by the time.

I chose Python because **I'm the most familiar with Python**. Plus, Python code is more readable and understandable than most of the other languages. And since this is a **command**-line project, which doesn't need to run fast, Python is the choice.

It requires the Skyblock Data repo, [Skyblock Data](https://github.com/peter-hunt/skyblock-data), which **will install and update automatically** (the main program updates the data every 12 hours).

# Reasons for installing Skyblock

Well, if you **don't want to buy Minecraft for 29.99 dollars**, and you **still want to play Hypixel Skyblock**, then this project is for you.

The project is also for people who **can't connect to Hypixel or having a bad connection**.

Even more, if you want to **cheat Skyblock**, then cheating on this project won't cost you a single dollar, including having up to \[YouTube\] rank perks for free, even getting admin items or having trillions of coins. And if you want to **make your custom content or mod it**, this project is for you.

Quotes from Simon are shown on [BlueCommander](https://www.youtube.com/c/BlueCommander)'s [Hypixel Skyblock Recreate release video](https://youtu.be/GvsjASwuZv4?t=80).

**Simon's quotes contain rules about remaking Hypixel Skyblock**, including not charging clones for money, not for monetization uses, not confusing other players thinking that this is the real Hypixel Skyblock. **This project is among all of the rules above, which could make this project valid**, but I haven't contracted with Hypixel staff for official permission yet.

# Warnings

**This project is still in heavy development**, so the data structures used for caching and saving data will change. If you'd like to play this game in Beta, and your saved files get out of date or just from strange bugs, your files can corrupt.

If your data folder corrupts, delete the whole `~/skyblock/data` folder to let the program fix it.

If your saved files go corrupt, then it's probably not going to be resolved.

# Installation

Use git command or GitHub install-as-zip to install Skyblock.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/peter-hunt/skyblock.git
```

## Running
